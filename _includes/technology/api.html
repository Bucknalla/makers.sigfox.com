        <p>
          Once a device sends a message, there are 3 ways to fetch & use the data :
          <ul>
            <li>Web interface on http://backend.sigfox.com</li>
            <li>REST API</li>
            <li>Callback mechanism</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <h3>REST API</h3>
        <p>
          To access the API, you need to set up your access first.<br />
          To do so, go to the <a href="https://backend.sigfox.com/group/">Group</a> section on http://backend.sigfox.com .<br />
          In the sidebar, click on API access & then click <i>New</i> in the top-right corner.<br />
          You should now see your credentials, and a link to the API documentation relevant to your access rights
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the API you can :
          <ul>
            <li>Retrieve the list of devices associated to a device type</li>
            <li>Retrieve the messages of a given device</li>
            <li>Get metrics about a device's messages</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <h3>Callbacks</h3>
        <p>
          You can subscribe to receive an HTTP callback for every message received & processed by the SIGFOX backend.<br />
          The following data will be sent to your application : 
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-9">
              <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-heading">Data sent in the callback body</div>
                <div class="panel-body">
                  One callback is called per emitted message. <br />
                  You can optionally subscribe to receive a callback each time a station receives your message. Deduplication will then occur on your side.<br /><br />
                  You can choose to receive the callback using a GET or POST HTTP request.

                <table class="table table-condensed table-striped table-hover">
                  <thead>

                    <tr>
                      <td>device</td>

                      <td>Timestamp of the message</td>
                      <td>seconds</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>data</td>
                      <td>The data payload you sent</td>
                      <td></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>rssi</td>
                      <td>Received Signal Strength Intensity on the base station that received your message. </td>
                      <td>dBm</td>
                    </tr>
                  </tbody>
                </table>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid side effects, you should send an <code>HTTP 200</code> response as soon as the callback is received on your side.<br />
          If the SIGFOX backend receives an error status, it assumes that the message wasn't properly received, and send a retry shortly after. This will be seen as another message by your system.<br />
